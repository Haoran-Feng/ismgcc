ISMGCC (InterStellar Medium Gaussian Component Clustering): Finding gas structures in molecular ISM using Gaussian decomposition and Graph theory

This repository contains the Python code that implements the method described in [arXiv link].
It is designed to find molecular gas structures from PPV data cubes, especially in the direction with crowded emissions, e.g., the inner galaxy.

The document is currently under construction.
