ISMGCC (InterStellar Medium Gaussian Component Clustering): Finding gas structures in molecular ISM using Gaussian decomposition and Graph theory

This repository contains the Python code that implements the method described in [arXiv link].
It is designed to find molecular gas structures from PPV data cubes, especially in the direction with crowded emissions, e.g., the inner galaxy.

The document is currently under construction.
Before its completion, please refer to the [tutorial](https://github.com/Haoran-Feng/ismgcc/blob/main/example/tutorial.ipynb).
